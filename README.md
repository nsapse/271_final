This project is an low level implementation of basic terminal i/o using MASM x86 assembly. The basic idea is that it:

1. Implements macros that get and display a string to the user prompting them to enter ten digits.
2. Stores the numeric values, currently in the form of ASCII characters, in an array
3. Implements procedures which convert strings of ascii characters into integer data using an algorithm which performs basic calculations based on the character's ASCII code.
4. Does basic arithmetic with hte integer data to calculate their sum and average.
5. Convertsnverts the integers into a string of ascii digits for display; and,
6. Displays the character strings representing the integers, their sum, and their average.

The project was originally completed as my final portfolio project for CS-271 - Architecture and Assembly at Oregon State University
